Writing an OpenMfx host
=======================

There is no detailed guide for writing hosts yet, you can find a first example in [the quick start intro](../QuickStart/integrating-openmfx-as-an-host.md). You may also refer to the examples page {ref}`HostExamples` and in particular the [OpenMfx for Blender](https://github.com/eliemichel/OpenMeshEffectForBlender) branch.
