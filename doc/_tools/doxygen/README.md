## Generated documentation

The autogenerated documentation relies on [doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org/). Once you have installed it, you can run it from this directory:

```bash
OpenMeshEffect/doc/generated $ doxygen Doxyfile
OpenMeshEffect/doc/generated $ doxygen Sdk.Doxyfile
```

This will generate documentation in HTML format in `output/html/`.
