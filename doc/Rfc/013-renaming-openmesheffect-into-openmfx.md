RFC013 - Renaming OpenMeshEffect into OpenMfx
=============================================

*Around early 2021*, @eliemichel

Referenced in RFC012

Current Situation
-----------------

The whole project is called *OpenMeshEffect*, which clearly states its goal.

Key limitations
---------------

This name is too long, as we witness people try to abbreviate it in practice, and come up with various and inconsistent proposals. Also, despite being clear, the name *OpenMeshEffect* is not easily recognizable, from a branding point of view.

Proposal
---------

### Action

 - Rename OpenMeshEffect into OpenMfx.

### Drawbacks

 - This is obviously a breaking change.

History
-------

 - *2021-06-08* Proposal was **adopted** at the same time as corners (see RFC004). Commit [OpenMfx@d376183](https://github.com/eliemichel/OpenMfx/commit/d376183517c175571d31542f039ba4b95f8cbd13)
