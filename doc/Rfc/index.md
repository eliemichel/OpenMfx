Requests for Comments
=====================

RFCs are documents written throughout the design of the OpenMfx standard. They intend to be an open log of the decisions that have been taken in the development of the project.

```{important}
We are writing this retrospectively, a lot of RFCs still need to be extracted from discussion logs and properly formatted. Pages will also need to be ordered chronologically.
