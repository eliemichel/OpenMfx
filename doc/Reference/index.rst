API Reference
=============

This is the API reference, describing all functions and objects present in the OpenMfx API. If you are looking for a more didactic document, have a look at the programming guide: :ref:`ProgrammingGuide`.

**Recommended fore-reading** Since OpenMfx is built on top of OpenFX, the reader should know about the bases of OpenFX Core by reading `OpenFX documentation <https://openfx.readthedocs.io/en/master/>`_.
