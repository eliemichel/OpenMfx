OpenMfx SDK
===========

The SDK is a C++ library that aims at making the development of plugins easier than using the raw OpenMfx API. For the reference of the underlying C API, see :ref:`ApiReference`. The SDK for writing plugins is also known as "CppPluginSupport".

To get started with the SDK, it is recommended to follow the tutorial: the tutorial :ref:`TutorialCppSdk`.

This document currently is a largely undocumented draft so it is more informational to refer to the C API at the moment. Feel free to give some feedback through the GitHub `issues <https://github.com/eliemichel/OpenMeshEffect/issues>`_ of this repository.
